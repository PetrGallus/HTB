# IPMI

* Intelligent Platform Management Interface
* HW-based host management systems used for sys management and monitorint
* autonomous subsystem which works independently of the hosts BIOS, CPU, firmware...
* 3 use-cases:
  * before OS has booted to modify BIOS config
  * when the host is fully powered down
  * access to a host after a system failure
* IPMI protocol was published by Intel in 1998
* \-p 623 (over UDP)
