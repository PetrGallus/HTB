You are after an organised crime group which is responsible for the illegal weapon market in your country. As a secret agent, you have infiltrated the group enough to be included in meetings with clients. During the last negotiation, you found one of the confidential messages for the customer. It contains crucial information about the delivery. Do you think you can decrypt it?


1. Files analysis
    - cat msg.enc
        - contains encrypted information
    - python3 chall.py
        - not working
    - nano chall.py
        - contains a short script
            - it will import the unencrypted information
            - encrypts it in a loop
            - creates and opens the msg.enc file, writes the result to it and closes it
            
            
2. Information decryption by reverse engineering
    - we need to create a reverse script that decrypts the message back
    - lets create a file decrypt.py
    
        -   def decryption(msg):                        # encryption -> decryption
                pt = []                                 # ct -> pt (plain text)
                for char in msg:
                    char = char - 18                    # chall.py pricitalo + 18
                    char = 179 * char % 256            
                    pt.append(char)
                return bytes(pt)

            with open("msg.enc") as f:  
                ct = bytes.fromhex(f.read())
 
            pt = decryption(ct)
            print(pt)    
    
3. Running the created script
    - python3 decrypt.py
        - result => secret information obtained + flag :)
            - b'Th3 nucl34r w1ll 4rr1v3 0n fr1d4y.\nHTB{l00k_47_y0u_r3v3rs1ng_3qu4710n5_c0ngr475}'
